This iOS app (iPhone only) utilizes the Realm mobile database to store and persist gender-neutral bathroom data. UNC community members can use the app to view bathroom locations on a map (utilizing MapBox API) or they can locate specific information about the bathroom using a search controller. For example, users can obtain the bathroom room number, floor number, availability (public or limited), signage and details. I'm planning to submit the app to UNC for future implementation. The app is meant to be simple for users: Look and locate.

Future iterations. There are a few details I would like to add. One is to add a second table view controller to filter information. The issue I had was making these connections using Realm; I could not get the predicates to work properly. However, the map is usable in its currnet state.
